            Welcome to [WIP TITLE]. This is a small project designed to show agent pathfinding in an interactive way.
            Using the controls in the right panel, you can place entities and types of terrain to create custom scenarios.
            There are also a number of settings to change what information is displayed, allowing for further investigation
            into how these systems work under the hood. This tutorial will explain the different tools availible to you,
            feel free to exit and reopen it at any time.
